# Federation

Being a federation protocol, Versia defines a set of rules for exchanging data between instances. This document outlines the behavior of instances in a Versia federated network. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Federation is built on the [HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) and the [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) data format. Instances communicate with each other by sending and receiving JSON payloads over HTTP. If you have ever worked with ActivityPub, Versia's federation protocol will feel familiar.

## Inboxes

<Note>
    See the [Inbox Endpoint](/api/endpoints#inbox) for more information on the inbox endpoint.
</Note>

Ever [Instance](/entities/instance-metadata) has a personal HTTP endpoint called an inbox (`/.versia/v0.6/inbox`). This endpoint is used to send and receive messages between users and instances. Messages are sent as JSON payloads over HTTP `POST` requests.

Let's consider the following example:

Alice, on the instance `alice.example`, sends a message to Bob on the instance `bob.example`.

To perform this action, Alice's instance sends a `POST` request to Bob's instance's inbox endpoint. This request contains the [Note](/entities/note) entity that Alice wants to send to Bob, with [the appropriate metadata](/federation/http) to ensure the message is valid.

Bob's instance receives the message and processes it according to the rules defined in the [Validation](/federation/validation) document.

## Outboxes

In addition to inboxes, every user has an outbox (at `/.versia/v0.6/entities/User/<id>/collections/outbox`). The outbox is simply a [Collection](/structures/collection) of all the messages that a user has sent. When a user sends a message to another user, a copy of that message is accessible in the sender's outbox.

<Warning>
    Implementations **should** filter out entities that are not relevant to the request author when returning the outbox.
    
    For example, if Alice sends a [Note](/entities/note) to Bob on `direct` visibility:
    - Alice's instance **should** return the [Note](/entities/note) in response to a request from Bob's instance.
    - Alice's instance **should not** display the [Note](/entities/note) in her outbox in response to a request from Joe's instance.
</Warning>

Outboxes are very useful for "backfilling" data when a new instance joins the network. By resolving the outboxes of all new users it encounters, a new instance can quickly catch up on all old messages.
