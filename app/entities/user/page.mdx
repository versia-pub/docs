# Users

The `User` entity represents an account on a Versia instance. Users can post [Notes](/entities/note), follow other users, and interact with content. Users are identified by their `id` property, which is unique within the instance. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Addresses

Users may be represented by a shorthand address, in the following formats:

```
@username@instance
@id@instance
```

For example:

```
@jessew@versia.social
@018ec082-0ae1-761c-b2c5-22275a611771@versia.social
```

This is similar to an email address or an ActivityPub address. Usernames are case-insensitive.

### Identifier

Identifier **must** be either a valid `username` or a valid `id`. It should have the same username/id as the user's profile.

<Note>
Usernames can be changed by the user, so it is recommended to use `id` for long-term references.
</Note>

### Instance

Instance **must** be the host of the instance the user is on (hostname with optional port).

        </Property>
        <Property name="bio" type="ContentFormat" required={false} typeLink="/structures/content-format">
            Short description of the user. Must be text format (`text/*`).

        </Property>
        <Property name="fields" type="Field[]" required={false}>
            Custom key/value pairs. For example, metadata like socials or pronouns. Must be text format (`text/*`).

            ```typescript
            type Field = {
                key: ContentFormat;
                value: ContentFormat;
            }
            ```
        </Property>
        <Property name="username" type="string" required={true}>
            Alpha-numeric username. Must be unique within the instance. **Must** be treated as changeable by the user.

            Can only contain the following characters: `a-z`, `A-Z` (case-insensitive), `0-9`, `_` and `-`. Should be limited to reasonable lengths.
        </Property>
        <Property name="header" type="ContentFormat" required={false} typeLink="/structures/content-format">
            A header image for the user's profile. Also known as a cover photo or a banner. Must be an image format (`image/*`).
        </Property>
        <Property name="public_key" type="PublicKey" required={true}>
            The user's public key. Must follow the [Versia Public Key](/signatures) format. `actor` may be a URI to another user's profile, in which case this key may allow the other user act on behalf of this user (see [delegation](/federation/delegation)).

            - `algorithm`: Must be `ed25519` for now.
            - `key`: The public key in SPKI-encoded base64 (from raw bytes, not a PEM format). Must be the key associated with the `actor` URI.
            - `actor`: URI to a user's profile, most often the user's own profile.

            ```typescript
            type URI = string;

            type PublicKey = {
                actor: URI;
                algorithm: string;
                key: string;
            }
            ```
        </Property>
        <Property name="manually_approves_followers" type="boolean" required={false}>
            If `true`, the user must approve any new followers manually. If `false`, followers are automatically approved. This does not affect federation, and is meant to be used for clients to display correct UI. Defaults to `false`.
        </Property>
        <Property name="indexable" type="boolean" required={false}>
            User consent to be indexed by search engines. If `false`, the user's profile should not be indexed. Defaults to `true`.
        </Property>
        <Property name="inbox" type="URI" required={true} typeLink="/types#uri">
            The user's federation inbox. Refer to the [federation documentation](/federation).

            Some instances may also have a shared inbox. Refer to [Instance Metadata](/entities/instance-metadata) for more information.
        </Property>
        <Property name="collections" type="UserCollections" required={true}>
            Collections related to the user. Must contain at least `outbox`, `followers`, `following`, and `featured`.

            ```typescript
            type URI = string;

            type UserCollections = {
                outbox: URI;
                followers: URI;
                following: URI;
                featured: URI;
                // Same format as type on Extensions
                [key: ExtensionsKey]: URI;
            }
            ```

            All URIs must resolve to either a [Collection](/structures/collection) or a [URI Collection](/structures/collection#uri-collection) of the appropriate entities. Extensions may add additional collections.

            ### Outbox
            The user's federation outbox. Refer to the [federation documentation](/federation). [Collection](/structures/collection) of [Note](/entities/note) entities.

            ### Followers
            User's followers. [URI Collection](/structures/collection#uri-collection) of [User](/entities/user) entities.

            ### Following
            Users that the user follows. [URI Collection](/structures/collection#uri-collection) of [User](/entities/user) entities.

            ### Featured
            [Notes](/entities/note) that the user wants to feature (also known as "pin") on their profile. [Collection](/structures/collection) of [Note](/entities/note) entities. Only notes authored by the user can be featured.
