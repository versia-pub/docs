# Delete

Signals the deletion of an entity. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Authorization

Implementations **must** ensure that the author of the `Delete` entity has the authorization to delete the target entity.

Having the authorization is defined as:
- The author is the creator of the target entity (including [delegation](/federation/delegation)).
- The author is the instance.
