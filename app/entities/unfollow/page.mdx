# Unfollow

Sometimes, [Users](/entities/user) want to unsubscribe from each other to stop seeing each other's content. The `Unfollow` defines such a change. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
    Refer to the [Follow](/entities/follow) entity for information on how follow relationships work.
</Note>

<Note>
    This is **not** used to remove a follower from a followee.

    For example, if Bob follows Alice, this entity is used when:
    - Bob wants to stop following Alice.

    **NOT** when:
    
    - Alice wants to remove Bob as a follower.

    For the latter, use [FollowReject](/entities/follow-reject).
