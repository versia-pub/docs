# FollowReject

<Note>
    Refer to the [Follow](/entities/follow) entity for information on how follow relationships work.
</Note>

## Removing followers

`FollowReject` can also be used *after* a follow relationship has been established to remove a follower.

For example, if Bob requests to follow Alice, this entity is used when:
- Alice wants to reject Bob's follow request.

But it can also be used when Bob is already following Alice, in the case that:
- Alice wants to remove Bob as a follower.
