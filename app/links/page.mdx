# Versia Links

Versia Links are a way to reference entities in the Versia Protocol, in a way that can be handled by browsers and applications. They function the same way as `mailto:` links, but for Versia entities.

## Syntax

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties>
            <Property name="scheme" type="string" required={true}>
                Must be `web+versia://` so that browsers and applications can recognize it.

                An IANA registration for the `versia://` scheme will be requested in the future.
            </Property>
            <Property name="instance" type="string" required={true}>
                Instance host, including the port if it is not the default (i.e. `443` for HTTPS).
            </Property>
            <Property name="action" type="string" required={true}>
                Action to take on the entity. Can have multiple slashes as a way to segment the action.

                Possible actions:

                - `users/:username`: Open a user profile.
                - `notes/:id`: Open a note.
                - `groups/:id`: Open a group.
                - `reply/:id`: Open the composer to reply to a note.
                - `quote/:id`: Open the composer to quote a note.
                - `share/:id`: Share a note.
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>

    <Col sticky>
        ``` {{ title: "Viewing a user profile" }}
        web+versia://bob.social/users/alice
        ```

        ``` {{ title: "Viewing a note" }}
        web+versia://jimbob.com/notes/01902e09-0f8b-72de-8ee3-9afc0cf5eae1
        ```

        ``` {{ title: "Replying to a note" }}
        web+versia://bob.social/reply/01902e09-0f8b-72de-8ee3-9afc0cf5eae1
        ```
    </Col>
</Row>

## Handling

Versia clients **should** register themselves as handlers for the `web+versia://` scheme in the user's operating system. When a Versia Link is clicked, the client should open the entity in the client's interface.

The default client ("frontend") on a Versia instance **should** also display Versia links for logged-out users on:
- Profiles
- Notes
- Groups

Clients **should** ask users to confirm any action that is not a simple view action, such as replying to a note or sharing a note.
