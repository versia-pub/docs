# Migration Extension

Sometimes, users may want to move their data from one instance to another. This could be due to a change in administration, a desire to be closer to friends, or any other reason. Migration can be done using the migration extension. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Behaviour

Migration happens in three steps:

### Prepare the New Account

- The user creates an account on the new instance, and puts the URI of the old account in the `previous` field of the new account.

### Request Migration

- The user requests migration from the old instance. The old instance checks that the `previous` field is set, and creates a migration entity.

- The migration entity is then distributed to every instance that interacts with the old instance, including the new instance.

- All instances that receive a verified migration entity (i.e. one where the `previous` field is correctly set on the new account) and support migration **must** then move all relationships (followers, followings, etc) from the old account to the new account in *their* internal database.

### Complete Migration

- The old instance sets the `new` field of the user to the URI of the new account, and marks it as "disabled" in its internal database.


## Entity Definition

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties>
            <Property name="uri" type="null" required={false}>
                This entity does not have a URI.
            </Property>
            <Property name="type" type="string" required={true}>
                Must be `pub.versia:migration/Migration`.
            </Property>
            <Property name="author" type="URI" typeLink="/types#uri" required={true}>
                URI of the [User](/entities/user) who is migrating.
            </Property>
            <Property name="destination" type="URI" required={true} typeLink="/types#uri">
                URI of the destination [User](/entities/user) on the new instance.
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>

    <Col sticky>

    ```json {{ title: "Example Entity" }}
    {
        "id": "016f3de2-ad63-4e06-999e-1e6b41c981c5",
        "type": "pub.versia:migration/Migration",
        "author": "https://example.com/users/44df6e02-ef43-47e0-aff2-47041f3d09ed",
        "created_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "destination": "https://otherinstance.social/users/73e999a0-53d0-40a3-a5cc-be0408004726",
    }
    ```

    </Col>
</Row>

## User Extensions

The following extensions to [User](/entities/user) are used by the migration extension:

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties>
            <Property name="previous" type="URI" required={true} typeLink="/types#uri">
                If this user has migrated from another instance, this property **MUST** be set to the URI of the user on the previous instance.
            </Property>
            <Property name="new" type="URI" required={false} typeLink="/types#uri">
                If this user has migrated to another instance, this property **MUST** be set to the URI of the user on the new instance.
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>

    <Col sticky>

    ```jsonc {{ 'title': 'Example' }}
    {
        // ...
        "type": "User",
        // ...
        "extensions": { // [!code focus:100]
            "pub.versia:migration": {
                "previous": "https://oldinstance.social/users/44df6e02-ef43-47e0-aff2-47041f3d09ed",
                // "new": "https://newinstance.social/users/73e999a0-53d0-40a3-a5cc-be0408004726",
            } 
        }
    }
    ```

    </Col>
</Row>
