# Likes Extension

The Likes extension adds support for users to like and dislike notes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Implementations should make sure that users cannot like and dislike the same note at the same time. If a user dislikes a note they have already liked, the like should be removed, and vice versa.

## Likes

Likes are a way for users to show appreciation for a note, like Twitter's "heart" button or Reddit's "upvote".

## Undoing Likes and Dislikes

To undo a like or dislike, a [Delete](/entities/delete) entity should be used. The `deleted` property of the Delete entity should link to the Like or Dislike entity to be removed.

## User Collections

The Likes extension adds the following collections to the [User](/entities/user) entity:

- `likes`: A [Collection](/structures/collection) of all the notes the user has liked.
- `dislikes`: A [Collection](/structures/collection) of all the notes the user has disliked.

```jsonc
{
    "type": "User",
    ...
    "collections": {
        ...
        "pub.versia:likes/Likes": "https://example.com/users/6e0204a2-746c-4972-8602-c4f37fc63bbe/likes",
        "pub.versia:likes/Dislikes": "https://example.com/users/6e0204a2-746c-4972-8602-c4f37fc63bbe/dislikes"
    }
}
