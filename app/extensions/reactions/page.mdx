# Reactions Extension

The Reactions Extension allows users to express their reactions ("react") to posts with emojis. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Federation

User reactions are (like every other entity) federated to all followers, and can be displayed to clients depending on the privacy settings of the associated [Note](/entities/note).

## Entity Definition

                Must be `pub.versia:reactions/Reaction`.
            </Property>
            <Property name="author" type="Reference" required typeLink="/types#reference">
                [Reference](/types#reference) to the [User](/entities/user) that is reacting.
