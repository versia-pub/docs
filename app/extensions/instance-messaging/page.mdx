# Instance Messaging Extension

Misconfigured or buggy instances often have trouble federating with others. This extension enables instances to send simple federation debug messages. {{ className: "lead" }}

<Note>
    This extension is intended to help developers debug federation issues between instances. It is not intended for general-purpose messaging.
</Note>

## Purpose

Often, federation "fails silently" with no indication of what went wrong, as instances are incapable of communicating with each other outside of administrators manually checking logs.

For example, let's consider the following scenario:
1. `joe.social` and `jane.org` are two instances.
2. `joe.social` tries to fetch a user profile from `jane.org`, at `jane.org/users/nkGEd8eI98` for example.
3. `jane.org` responds with a [User](/entities/user) object with a missing or incorrect field, such as an improperly validated `username`.
4. `joe.social` is incapable of processing the response and silently fails to fetch the user profile.

In this scenario, `jane.org` has no way of knowing what went wrong, as `joe.social` does not provide any feedback.

## Instance Metadata Extensions

This extension adds the following metadata to instances:

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties name="InstanceMessagingExtension">
            <Property name="endpoint" type="string" required={true}>
                The endpoint to send federation debug messages to.

                ### Sending Messages

                To send a federation debug message, instances **should** make a `POST` request to the appropriate endpoint with a simple text body containing a helpful message.

                ```text {{ "title": "Helpful Message" }}
                Validation failed for https://jane.org/users/nkGEd8eI98.
                Reasons:
                  - `username` must be alphanumeric. Found invalid character `@`.
                ```

                Do not send useless messages, such as:

                ```text {{ "title": "Unhelpful Message" }}
                Federation failed.
                ```
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>
