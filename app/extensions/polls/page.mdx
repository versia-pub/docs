# Polls Extension

Polls (also known as surveys) are a useful tool for gathering feedback from followers and friends. The Polls Extension allows users to create and vote on polls. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Privacy

Individual user votes on polls should **not** be visible in clients. Instead, clients should display the total number of votes for each option, and the total number of votes cast.

This is reflected in the presence of total votes as numbers and not as an array of URIs in polls.

## Extensions to Note

Note that there is no `question` field: the question should be included in the `content` of the Note itself.

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties name="Polls">
            <Property name="options" type="ContentFormat[]" required="true">
                Array of options for the poll. Each option is a [ContentFormat](/structures/content-format) that can contain the same properties as a Note's `content` (e.g. [Custom Emojis](/extensions/custom-emojis) or HTML hyperlinks).
            </Property>
            <Property name="votes" type="number[]" required="true" numberType="u64">
                Array of the number of votes for each option. The length of this array should match the length of the `options` array.
            </Property>
            <Property name="multiple_choice" type="boolean" required="true">
                Whether the poll allows multiple votes to be cast for different options.
            </Property>
            <Property name="expires_at" type="RFC3339" typeLink="/types#rfc3339">
                RFC 3339 timestamp of when the poll ends and no more votes can be cast. If not present, the poll does not expire.
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>

## Vote Entity Definition
