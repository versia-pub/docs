# Share Extension

The Share Extension lets users share notes they like with others. This is the same as Twitter's "retweet" and Mastodon's "boost". {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Behaviour

When a user shares a note, the note's original author **must** receive the entity alongside the user's followers. In clients, `Shares` should be rendered in a way that makes it clear that the shared note was originally authored by someone else than the user who shared it.

`Shares` can be undone ("unboosting") with a [Delete](/entities/delete) entity.
