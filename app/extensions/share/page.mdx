# Share Extension

The Share Extension lets users share notes they like with others. This is the same as Twitter's "retweet" and Mastodon's "boost". {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Behaviour

When a user shares a note, the note's original author **must** receive the entity alongside the user's followers. In clients, `Shares` should be rendered in a way that makes it clear that the shared note was originally authored by someone else than the user who shared it.

`Shares` can be undone ("unboosting") with a [Delete](/entities/delete) entity.

## Entity Definition

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties name="Share">
            <Property name="type" type="string" required={true}>
                Must be `pub.versia:share/Share`.
            </Property>
            <Property name="author" type="URI" required={true} typeLink="/types#uri">
                Creator of the Share.
            </Property>
            <Property name="shared" type="URI" required={true} typeLink="/types#uri">
                URI of the note being shared. Must link to a [Note](/entities/note).
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>

    <Col sticky>

    ```jsonc {{ 'title': 'Example Share' }}
    {
        "id": "3e7e4750-afd4-4d99-a256-02f0710a0520",
        "type": "pub.versia:share/Share",
        "created_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "author": "6e0204a2-746c-4972-8602-c4f37fc63bbe",
        "shared": "otherexample.org:fmKZ763jzIU8"
    }
    ```

    </Col>
</Row>

## Note Collections

The Share extension adds the following collections to the [Note](/entities/note) entity:

- `shares`: A [URI Collection](/structures/collection#uri-collection) of all the shares of the note.

```jsonc
{
    "type": "Note",
    ...
    "collections": {
        ...
        "pub.versia:share/Shares": "https://example.com/notes/fmKZ763jzIU8/shares"
    }
}
```

## Interaction Types

<Note>
    This section only applies to implementors of the [Interaction Controls Extension](/extensions/interaction-controls).
</Note>

This extension registers the following interaction types:
- `pub.versia:share#Share`, for sharing a Note.
